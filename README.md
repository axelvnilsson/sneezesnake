# sneezesnake
When I make it big, I will name my basketball team the Sneeze Snakes.
They will beat the Lakers

                        Ideas!

2. Make the snake more realistic the farther you go on in the game, and start out basic.
3. A powerup when you pick it up and die you respawn and your score does not change.
4. Multiplayer.
5. The chaser will grow the same way the snake does, only when a food appears for the chaser.
6. Graphic affect when you die.
7. Make a wormhole to a different part of the area.
8. Randomly a forcefield will spawn on the edges of the area making you bounce back when you hit them. 
9. A banner at the bottom including real facts about snakes.             
                        
                        Later projects

1. Make a settings menu.
