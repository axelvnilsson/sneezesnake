Title: "Sneeze Snakes Swing"

(Verse 1)
In the world of Sneeze Snakes, we’re jumping in,
Next-level fun, let the games begin!
Slither and slide, a hiss in the breeze,
Dodge the chasers, sneeze after sneeze.

(Chorus)
Sneeze Snakes Swing, it's a wild ride,
Twist and turn with your scales side by side.
If you catch the chaser, you’re the top rock,
Dance to the rhythm, around the clock.

(Verse 2)
Sneaky moves in the neon lights,
Serpentine grooves, to fantastic heights.
Every level up, the stakes will climb,
In this slithery, slippery, sneezy rhyme.

(Bridge)
Dash through the mist, where the cool snakes roam,
In this arcade world, feel right at home.
Flick your tongue, catch the prize,
Under the arcade skies.

(Chorus)
Sneeze Snakes Swing, it's a wild ride,
Twist and turn with your scales side by side.
If you catch the chaser, you’re the top rock,
Dance to the rhythm, around the clock.

(Outro)
So let’s start the game, no time to freeze,
Join the adventure with the Sneeze Snakes, please!
Level by level, we’ll all have a blast,
In this game where fun is vast.
